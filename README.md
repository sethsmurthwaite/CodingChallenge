# Coding Challenge!!
Coding Challenge for OIT application.


My code is simple and follows the rules set forth in the challenge instructions. I coded my soluiton in C++ on CLion and the code is run through command line arguments. The code checks that the the input is valid, and if it is, will return the correct number based on the input!

I have inluded in this repository the executable file, the .cpp file, and the CMakeLists.txt file.

Hope to hear back soon!
